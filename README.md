### Hi there! 👋 I'm Carmen, but you can call me Lia
🎓 Economist by background, but now on a new path: learning Web Development.  
💻 I'm diving into HTML, CSS, and JavaScript with passion and curiosity.  
🚀 From the very first lines of code, I knew I wanted to explore more.

### What I'm doing now:
- 📘 Studying the fundamentals of programming and front-end development
- ✍️ Building small projects with HTML and CSS
- 🧠 Learning how to use Git and GitHub to organize my code
  
### What's next:
- 🔧 Deepen my understanding of JavaScript
- 🌐 Build a personal portfolio website
- 💡 Explore frameworks like React and modern web tools
  
### A few fun facts:
- 🍵 I start my day with cinnamon tea and a bit of code
- 📚 I enjoy learning in my own rhythm and keeping notes
- ✨ Seeing my code work—even just a little—makes me smile 😄
